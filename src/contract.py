"""The client's scoring rule, as code. Read it; do not change it.

The hotel group judges any oversell policy the same way, whichever method produced it, so every team
is scored on the same terms. This file holds that rule and nothing else: it does not choose your
bookings, your columns, your method or your buffer. Those are your team's decisions.

The rule in words (docs/EVALUATION_CONTRACT.md says the same thing):
  - The unit is one hotel on one arrival night. A night's book is every booking due to arrive that night.
  - Your policy sells k extra rooms for that night. If more bookings cancel than k, the difference
    stays empty; if fewer cancel than k, the difference is guests walked to another hotel.
  - An empty room costs the night's average booked stay value (ADR x nights of that night's bookings).
  - A walked guest costs WALK_COST euros.
  - A policy is acceptable only if it walks at most WALK_CEILING guests per 1,000 arrivals.
  - Train on arrivals before TRAIN_END, choose on arrivals from TRAIN_END to PROOF_START, and prove
    once on arrivals from PROOF_START. Use the proof period once, at the end.
